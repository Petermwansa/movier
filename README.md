# movier



# ================= STEP 1 ==================
So, on the first step of creating this website, I added pure html to create the outline and skeleton of the movier movie streaming website.

I used Figma tp design the logo. Not the best design I am not a designer yet but it will do for now I think ;)



# ================= STEP 2 ==================
The second part of the project involved workeing with css inline styling within the html file;



# ================= STEP 3 ==================
Do the responsive design for the website to be responsive on all screen sizes.
I used the css grid to make the components suit each screen size and I used the media queries to achieve the responsives of the website.


# ================= STEP 4 ==================
Add the theme toggle using javascript in a seperate Javascript file.
This will toggle the theme while clicking on the sun or moon element in the right top corner of the website.
